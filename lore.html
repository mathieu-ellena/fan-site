                    <h1> First ending</h1>
                
                <p>Niko, a catlike child, awakes in a dark and unfamiliar house. They interact with an in-game computer, which addresses the player using the current login name taken from their computer. According to the machine, the world that Niko currently resides in is collapsing, and the player's goal is to guide them back to their homeworld. Niko discovers the world's sun, a lightbulb, and uses it to exit the house, emerging in a barren wasteland. In there, they encounter a robot, which tells them that they are prophesied to save the world. Niko's goal is to carry the sun through its three areas, and place it at the apex of a central tower to restore daylight. They are currently in the "Barrens". The robot teaches Niko to communicate with the player, telling Niko that the player is a god of the game's world whose responsibility is to guide the "Messiah" Niko. Niko meets Silver, a more sentient "tamed" robot, who gifts them a piece of amber that Niko uses as a guide to the next area.

                Now in the arboreal "Glen", Niko converses with the area's residents, including siblings Alula and Calamus, who gift Niko a glowing feather. Niko uses it to create a feather pen to get past a guard robot, which lets them enter the urbanized third area, the "Refuge", and travel down to the city's surface with the aid of a lamplighter. Arriving at a library, they are directed to the librarian George, and get her attention with the help of researcher Kip Silverpoint. After some study, George translates Niko's book, a journal previously obtained from the Barrens. It states that the tower, which is controlled by an "entity", can be accessed using three phosphoric items. Niko has two such items on hand – the piece of amber and the glowing feather – and George gifts them the final one.

                Niko arrives at the tower, but the player is unable to speak to them. The entity informs Niko that both they and the player have won, and that Niko will return home now. The player finds a note as their new desktop wallpaper, telling them how to reconnect with Niko. By following the instructions, the player reappears and learns from a mysterious figure, "the Author", that the entity has grown out of control and become destructive. Once at the top, the Author informs them that they can either break the sun and return Niko home, which would destroy the world, or place the sun at the top of the tower, trapping Niko in this world. Niko leaves the decision up to the player, forming the game's endings. If the player chooses to place the sun, the world becomes brighter, and in the credits, the characters are in awe. If the player chooses to destroy the sun, Niko states that they hear their mother's voice outside the game's window before saying goodbye and walking offscreen.

                <h1>Ending 2 : Solstice (true ending)</h1>

                "Solstice" path
                After completing the game, a note appears in the user's Documents folder, allowing the player to continue on the alternate "Solstice" ending path.[13] The story is identical to the main game, but Niko possesses the Author's journal from the Barrens from the beginning. When Niko meets Silver in the Barrens and enters the mines, they travel to an observation room instead and meet Proto, an advanced prototype of the prophet robot. Proto reminds Niko of the events of the original storyline, which took place before this repeat. According to them, the world is a simulation, termed the "World Machine"; this new run is a reset of the machine.

                Niko, Silver, and Proto travel to the Glen, but the latter two are crushed by a rockfall. Niko uses the backup memory disk given by Proto to restore them. In the Glen, Niko meets Calamus and Alula again, and repairs the local mechanic Cedric's plane. Cedric says that his father was the Author, who created the World Machine to replace the previous world after its destruction. Niko and Cedric take his plane to the Refuge, and Cedric uses the backup memory disk to restore Proto, instructing Niko to find Rue, a sentient fox. Rue reveals that the World Machine is the original game's entity, and Niko's presence in the world corrupted it. Cedric and a restored Proto reappear, and alongside Niko, they enter the World Machine's inner system, "taming" it and reversing its destructive behavior. Niko places the sun at the tower and restores the world, resurrecting the characters that had died, and Niko returns home.
